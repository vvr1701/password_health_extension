# Password Health & Autofill Chrome Extension

## Project Overview
This is a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) project that provides real-time password strength checking and secure password generation with intelligent autofill capabilities. The extension demonstrates security best practices including HTTPS verification, smart field detection, and visual feedback.

## Recent Changes
- **Initial Setup (October 24, 2025)**
  - Created Manifest V3 extension with four core files
  - Implemented real-time password strength checker with color-coded indicators
  - Built secure password generator (16 chars, all character types)
  - Added intelligent autofill with autocomplete attribute detection
  - Implemented HTTPS protocol verification before autofill
  - Created visual feedback system (field highlighting + success banner)
  - Set up test page with HTTP server for demo purposes

## Project Architecture

### Extension Files
1. **manifest.json**: Manifest V3 configuration
   - Permissions: activeTab, scripting
   - Content script runs on all URLs
   - Popup interface for user interaction

2. **popup.html**: Extension popup UI
   - Password generator button
   - Autofill demo button
   - Generated password display area
   - Modern gradient design with glassmorphism

3. **popup.js**: Popup logic
   - Secure password generation function
   - Message passing to content script
   - Event handlers for user interactions

4. **content.js**: Content script (runs on all pages)
   - Password field detection and monitoring
   - Real-time strength checking algorithm
   - Smart username field detection
   - HTTPS verification logic
   - Visual feedback animations
   - Message listener for autofill commands

### Test Infrastructure
- **index.html**: Demo page with login form
- **Python HTTP Server**: Serves test page on port 5000

## Key Features

### Password Strength Algorithm
- **Weak (Red)**: < 8 chars OR only 1 character type
- **Moderate (Orange)**: 8-11 chars with 2+ types, OR 12+ chars with 2-3 types
- **Strong (Green)**: 12+ chars with all 4 types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

### Security Features
1. **HTTPS Verification**: Checks protocol before autofill, blocks HTTP (except localhost)
2. **Smart Field Detection**: Uses autocomplete attributes and common field patterns
3. **Console Logging**: Security checks logged for transparency
4. **Visual Confirmation**: Animated field highlighting + success banner

### Autofill Logic
1. Username field detection priority:
   - `autocomplete="username"` or `autocomplete="email"`
   - Common name/id patterns (email, user, username)
   - Fallback to first visible text input
2. Password field: First visible password input
3. Both fields trigger input/change events for form validation compatibility

## Installation & Usage

### Load Extension in Chrome
1. Open chrome://extensions/
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this project directory
5. Extension appears in toolbar

### Test the Extension
1. Visit the test page (served on port 5000)
2. Type in password field → See strength indicator
3. Click extension icon → Generate password → Autofill demo
4. Observe field highlighting and success banner

## Technology Stack
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
